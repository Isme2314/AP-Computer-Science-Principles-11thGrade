# Functions
'''A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameter, into a function. A function can get data as a result'''
# Creating a function
# In python a function is created using the def keyword
def my_function (fname):
  print (fname + " Joaquin")
my_function("pizza")
# Calling a Function
# To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis
def my_Function (fname):
  print (fname + "Joaquin")
my_Function ("pizza")
# Parameters or arguments
# The terms parameter and argument can be used for the same thing; info that are passed into a function
# A parameter is the variable listed inside the parenthesis in the function definition
# An argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called
def my_function (fname,lname):
  print(fname + " " + lname)
my_function("Carlos" , "Campuzano")
# Python Class
# To create a class, use keyword class
# create a class named MyClass, with a property named x:
class MyClass :
  x=5

# Create an object
# Now we can use the class name MyClass to create an object
# Create an object named g1, and print the value of x
g1 = MyClass ()
print (g1.x)
# The _init_ () function
# Use the underscore _init_ () function to assign values for name and age :

# Example create a class named Person, use the _init_(function) to assign values for name and age
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
p1=Person ("john", 36)
print (p1.name)
print (p1.age)
# note the _init_() function is called automatically everytime the class is being used to create a new object
# Python Inheritance
# Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherit all the methods and properties from anoth class
# Parent class is the class being inherited from also called base class
# Child class is : the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class
# Any class can be parent, so syntax is the same as creating another class 
# ex: create a class named Person, with firstname and lastname properties, and a printname method
class Person: #Parent class
  def _init_ (self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname
def print (self):
  print (self.firstname, self.lastname)
  # use the person class to create an object, and then execute the printname method
x= Person ("john", "doe")
x.printname()
#child class
# to create a class that inherits the functionality from another class, send the parent class as a parameter when creating the child class
# ex. assignment prompt: create a class named student which will inherit the properties and methods from the Person class
class Student (Person):
  pass
#ex: use the student class to create and object, and then execute the printname method 
  x = student ("Mike","Olsen")
  x.printname()
